# Word Embeddings with Gensim

This project demonstrates how to create **word embeddings** from a text corpus using **Gensim**, a popular Python library for unsupervised topic modeling and NLP (the entire Harry Potter collection).

> This project is implemented as a **Jupyter Notebook** and can be run directly in **Google Colab** for easy execution.
